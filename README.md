# Concept
For Concept Documentation and Collaboration

This repo is for concept work only, this is not an active compiling or project code.

Charts and Illustrations should be in Draw.io XML to allow many users view this without software.
XML, JSON, or similar markups can be used as well as general written language files. If a specific software (please try and stay opensource or common access tools) is needed for a file please mark that in the description.

Any questions may be directed to a project leader or relevant author. If you do not know who that is, or cannot contact them, feel free to contact the project coordinator.
